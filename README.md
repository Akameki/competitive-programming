# Akameki/competitive-Programming
*What's this for?*
* Lets me store and sync work between computers
* Lets me keep track of all the cp-related work I've done in one place
* Lets you see possible solutions (free to ask me for help on any problem I've solved)
* ...Maybe I will add personal resources/notes for myself sometime


## What's in here?
Mainly just my solutions to problems separated by competitions/sites.
For contests I participated in, files in `/contests/` will contain my actual submissions whereas files in `/problemset/` will have accepted upsolves (can be the same).
